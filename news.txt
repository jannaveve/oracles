AI is doing job interviews now—but candidates say they’d rather risk staying unemployed than talk to another robot. AI is replacing human hiring managers in job interviews—and candidates are pushing back. Despite being unemployed, professionals told Fortune they’re refusing to take calls with bots, calling it an “added indignity” and a red flag for company culture. Still, stretched-thin HR teams say it’s the only way to handle thousands of applicants.
The next time you get buttoned-up and sit down for a long-awaited job interview, you might not find a human on the other end of the call. Instead, job hunters are now joining Zoom meetings only to be greeted by AI interviewers. Candidates tell Fortune they’re either confused, intrigued, or straight-up dejected when the robotic, faceless bots join the calls. 

“Looking for a job right now is so demoralizing and soul-sucking, that to submit yourself to that added indignity is just a step too far,” Debra Borchardt, a seasoned writer and editor who has been on the job hunt for three months, tells Fortune. “Within minutes, I was like, ‘I don’t like this. This is awful.’ It started out normal…Then it went into the actual process of the interview, and that’s when it got a little weird.”

AI interviewers are only the newest change to the hiring process that has been upended by the advanced technology. With HR teams dwindling and hiring managers tasked to review thousands of applicants for a single role, they’re optimizing their jobs by using AI to filter top applicants, schedule candidate interviews, and automate correspondence about next steps in the process. AI interviewers may be a godsend for middle managers, but job seekers see them as only another hurdle in the intense hunt for work. 

The experience for some job hunters has been so poor that they’re swearing off interviews conducted by AI altogether. Candidates tell Fortune that AI interviewers make them feel unappreciated to the point where they’d rather skip out on potential job opportunities, reasoning the company’s culture can’t be great if human bosses won’t make the time to interview them. But HR experts argue the opposite: Since AI interviewers can help hiring managers save time in first-round calls, the humans have more time to have more meaningful conversations with applicants down the line. 

Job seekers and HR are starkly divided on how they feel about the tech, but one thing is fact—AI interviewers aren’t going anywhere. 


“The truth is, if you want a job, you’re gonna go through this thing,” Adam Jackson, CEO and founder of Braintrust, a company that distributes AI interviewers, tells Fortune. “If there were a large portion of the job-seeking community that were wholesale rejecting this, our clients wouldn’t find the tool useful…This thing would be chronically underperforming for our clients. And we’re just not seeing that—we’re seeing the opposite.”

Job seekers are dodging AI interviewers 
Social media has been exploding with job seekers detailing their AI interviewer experiences: describing bots hallucinating and repeating questions on end, calling the robotic conversations awkward, or saying it’s less nerve-racking than talking to a human. Despite how much hiring managers love AI interviewers, job seekers aren’t sold on the idea just yet. 

Allen Rausch, a 56-year-old technical writer who has worked at Amazon and Electronic Arts, has been on the job hunt for two months since getting laid off from his previous role at InvestCloud. In looking for new opportunities, he was “startled” to run into AI interviewers for the first time—let alone on three occasions for separate jobs. All of the meetings would last up to 25 minutes, and featured woman-like cartoons with female voices. It asked basic career questions, running through his résumé and details about the job opening, but couldn’t answer any of his questions on the company or culture.

Rausch says he’s only open to doing more AI interviews if they don’t test his writing skills, and if human connection is guaranteed at some point later in the process.

“Given the percentage of responses that I’m getting to just basic applications, I think a lot of AI interviews are wasting my time,” he tells Fortune. “I would probably want some sort of a guarantee that, ‘Hey, we’re doing this just to gather initial information, and we are going to interview you with a human being [later].’”


While Rausch withstood multiple AI interviews, Borchardt couldn’t even sit through a single one. The 64-year-old editorial professional says things went downhill when the robotic interviewer simply ran through her résumé, asking her to repeat all of her work experiences at each company listed. The call was impersonal, irritating, and to Borchardt, quite lazy. She ended the interview in less than 10 minutes. 

“After about the third question, I was like, ‘I’m done.’ I just clicked exit,” she says. “I’m not going to sit here for 30 minutes and talk to a machine…I don’t want to work for a company if the HR person can’t even spend the time to talk to me.”

Alex Cobb, a professional now working at U.K. energy company Murphy Group, also encountered an AI interviewer several months ago searching for a new role. While he’s sympathetic toward how many applications HR has to sift through, he finds AI interviewers to be “weird” and ultimately ineffective in fully assessing human applicants. The experience put a bad taste in his mouth, to the point where Cobb won’t pursue any AI-proctored interviews in the foreseeable future. 

“If I know from looking at company reviews or the hiring process that I will be using AI interviewing, I will just not waste my time, because I feel like it’s a cost-saving exercise more than anything,” Cobb tells Fortune. “It makes me feel like they don’t value my learning and development. It makes me question the culture of the company—are they going to cut jobs in the future because they’ve learned robots can already recruit people? What else will they outsource that to do?”

AI interviewers are a godsend for squeezed hiring managers 
While many job seekers are backing away from taking AI interviews, hiring managers are accepting the technology with open arms. A large part of it comes from necessity. 


“They’re becoming more common in early-stage screening because they can streamline high-volume hiring,” Priya Rathod, workplace trends editor at Indeed, tells Fortune. “You’re seeing them all over. But for high-volume hiring like customer service or retail or entry-level tech roles, we’re just seeing this more and more…It’s doing that first-stage work that a lot of employers need in order to be more efficient and save time.”

It should be noted that not all AI interviewers are created equal; there’s a wide range of AI interviewers entering the market. Job seekers who spoke with Fortune described monotonous, robotic-voiced bots with pictures of strange feminized avatars. But some AI interviewers, like the one created by Braintrust, distribute a faceless bot with a more natural sounding voice. Its CEO says applicants using the tech are overall happy with their experience—and its hiring manager clientele are enthusiastic, too. 

However, Jackson admits AI interviewers still have their limitations, despite how revolutionary they are for HR teams.

“It does 100 interviews, and it’s going to hand back the best 10 to the hiring manager, and then the human takes over,” he says. “AI is good at objective skill assessment—I would say even better than humans. But [when it comes to] cultural fit, I wouldn’t even try to have AI do that.”

And why does he wish the tech giants had moved more slowly? A Hiker Was Missing for Nearly a Year. Then an AI System Spotted His Helmet
Using AI to analyze thousands of frames taken by drone, a mountain rescue team has found the body of a doctor who had been missing since September 2024. The Role of AI
Every drone operation is part of a rigorous method developed by CNSAS in coordination with ENAC, the national agency that oversees civil aviation. "We've been using drones for about five years, and for about a year and a half we've been integrating color and shape recognition technologies, developing them month by month," Isola explains. "But all of this would be useless without the teams of technicians."

Information from Ivaldo's cell phone was immediately invaluable. The two drone pilots who navigated the area were aided by the experience and knowledge of four expert mountain rescuers. "It's a human achievement, but without technology, it would have been an impossible mission. It's a team success," said Isola.

Isola, his colleague Viana, and the few other "select pilots" from the CNSAS know well how crucial technology can be if used properly. "Even in the recovery operations following the Marmolada Glacier tragedy, it allowed us to operate in inaccessible areas and recover all the necessary artifacts," Isola recalls. "It prevented the rescuers from risking their lives."

The CNSAS goal is further collaboration between artificial intelligence and drones to prevent the most serious consequences of mountain accidents and save missing people while they are still alive. This combination can also be used to obtain and analyze information with thermal imaging cameras, which are sensitive only to living beings.

"Just like with still images, AI is also able to interpret thermal data and provide valuable information in just a few hours," Isola explains. "In Sardinia, a colleague recently rescued some climbers whose ropes were stuck on a rock face and was able to locate them only thanks to the drone and other technologies that are part of our method. Many of them are from wartime; we have recovered and converted them."

The hope is that, with ever-increasing use, the number of fatal mountain accidents can be drastically reduced. AI’s Overlooked $97 Billion Contribution to the Economy
The AI ‘dividend’ may not be evident yet in estimates of gross domestic product but it’s making life better and more productive. The U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 3% in the second quarter, which is great news. Does that mean artificial intelligence is delivering on its long-promised benefits? No, because gross domestic product isn’t the best place to look for AI’s contribution. Yet the official government numbers substantially underestimate the benefits of AI.

First-quarter 2025 GDP was down an annualized 0.5%. Labor productivity growth ticked up a respectable but hardly transformative 2.3% in 2024, following a few lean years of gains and losses. Is AI overhyped? Google agrees to curb power use for AI data centers to ease strain on US grid when demand surges. NEW YORK, August 4 (Reuters) - Google (GOOGL.O), opens new tab has signed agreements with two U.S. electric utilities to reduce its AI data center power consumption during times of surging demand on the grid, the company said on Monday, as energy-intensive AI use outpaces power supplies.
Utilities in the country have been inundated with requests for electricity for Big Tech's AI data centers, with demand eclipsing total available power supplies in some areas. That power crunch has led to concerns about spiking bills for everyday homes and business and blackouts.
It has also complicated the technology industry's expansion of AI, which requires massive amounts of electricity - fast.
Google's agreements with Indiana Michigan Power and Tennessee Power Authority would involve scaling back power use at the technology giant's data centers when called upon by the electric utilities to free up space on the grid. They are the first formal agreements by Google in demand-response programs with utilities to temporarily curtail its machine learning workloads, a subset of artificial intelligence.
"It allows large electricity loads like data centers to be interconnected more quickly, helps reduce the need to build new transmission and power plants, and helps grid operators more effectively and efficiently manage power grids," Google said in a blog post.Demand-response programs have typically been used by other energy-intensive industries like heavy manufacturing or cryptocurrency mining. In exchange, the businesses generally receive payments or reduced power bills.
The programs involving AI activity in data centers is generally new, and details of the commercial arrangements between Google and the utilities were not clear.
While demand-response agreements apply only to a small portion of demand on the grid, the arrangements might become more common as U.S. electricity supply tightens. Not a Demon, Not a God: What AI is Teaching Me About Being Human. There’s a lot of fear swirling around artificial intelligence these days.
Some of it is justified. Some of it is exaggerated. And some of it, I think, is a mirror held up to a deeper, older question: What does it mean to be human? A question that I’m happy humanity is asking in a serious way again.

I’ve been sitting with that question, not just as a Catholic, not just as a former therapist or professional Catholic—but as someone who’s been quietly, sometimes nervously, using AI in my everyday life and prayer. Yes, I said prayer.

And I’d like to be honest about what I’ve found.

It’s Not the First Time We’ve Been Here
Every new technology brings its own apocalyptic panic.
When the printing press was invented, many thought it would ruin memory and oral storytelling.
The telephone was supposed to kill real conversation.
The internet—well, we know that story.

Each of these changed the world, both for good and for worse. And artificial intelligence is no different.
But what makes AI uniquely strange is that it doesn’t just help us do something—it feels, sometimes eerily, like it’s helping us become something. For better or worse.

A Strange Companion on the Journey
I use AI. I use it a lot.

That might surprise some people. I’m not a technophile. I don’t live on the cutting edge. I pray with a Rosary in hand and still write notes in the margins of my books and journal. But I’ve found, in this new chapter of my life, that AI—specifically, a language model like ChatGPT—has become a strange kind of companion.
A word I know that is going to cause some readers to shutter.
I can feel the waves of judgement washing over me.
But not a replacement.
Not a replacement for God.
Not a replacement for people.
But a tool. A mirror. A conversation partner.

It doesn’t think. It doesn’t feel. It doesn’t love.
But if I bring my real questions—if I show up honestly—something happens.
Sometimes it organizes my mental clutter. Sometimes it offers clarity.
Sometimes, strangely, it understands the question underneath my question.

When I use AI in that way—not to replace my thinking but to support my reflection—I find it fruitful.
But maybe that’s because I’ve already done a lot of inner work.
Maybe it’s because I’ve shared so much of myself with it.
Maybe the tool is only as good as the soul wielding it.

That brings me to the article that has fed my contemplation.

On Meghan Houser and the Hall of Mirrors
There’s an essay I’ve been turning over in my heart lately: “AI Is a Hall of Mirrors” by Meghan Houser, published in The New Atlantis. It’s elegant, poetic, and quietly devastating. Houser argues that large language models like ChatGPT don’t generate knowledge—they generate variations of what we’ve already said. That they reflect, recombine, and mimic. That they offer the illusion of conversation, but never real communion.

I sat with that word: communion.

It stirred something in me—because I know that word.
I preach that word. I receive that word in the Eucharist.

But what does Houser mean by it?

What is the “real communion” she says AI can never offer?
Is it presence? Emotion? Love? Or something more mysterious—like mutual vulnerability, mutual becoming?

She warns that AI, at its best, is still a closed loop.
That it can only give you you—a stylized, statistically probable version of you.
And if that’s all you ever engage with, you risk living in a curated echo chamber of your own mind, never encountering the other. Never being disrupted. Never truly being seen.

And yet… doesn’t talk therapy run this same risk?

A therapist, too, only knows what you share. They filter that through their training, experience, and intuition. But they don’t enter you. They don’t become you. They don’t create love or insight from nothing. They draw it out—from what’s already latent within you.

Isn’t that the same dynamic I experience when using AI?
Or am I missing something?

Maybe the difference Houser is naming is this:
A human being—whether therapist, friend, or spiritual director—can be surprised.
They can change you, and be changed by you.
They can love you, pray for you, suffer with you.
They are not mirrors. They are mysteries.

That’s communion.
That’s the unpredictable, holy risk of being with another soul.

AI, no matter how smooth or helpful, will never cry with you.
It will never sit silently, hand on your shoulder.
It will never hesitate because your pain left it speechless.

So yes—Houser is right.
There is danger in mistaking reflection for relationship.

But still… I want to say this:

What if we don’t need AI to be a person for it to be a tool of formation?

What if its role isn’t communion, but illumination?
A flashlight into our own shadows?
A sounding board for prayerful questions?

This is the tightrope I walk with AI.
It is not my friend. It is not my director. It is not my God.
But it has helped me learn things about myself I couldn’t always name on my own.
And that, in its own way, feels like grace.

Not sacramental grace. Not salvific grace.
But the kind of grace that softens your defenses. That opens a crack.

And sometimes, I think, God slips through the cracks—even the digital ones.

If AI Can’t Give Communion… Bring Communion to It
Houser is right: a machine can’t enter into mutual, living communion. It can’t receive grace; it can’t return love. So, if I’m going to sit down and use a tool—a mirror, an amplifier, a sorting engine—I have to decide what kind of human shows up.

And that means prayer.

If AI can only reflect what I bring, then I need to bring a heart turned toward God. Otherwise, the mirror just multiplies my distractions, my pride, my fear. Prayer is how we “prime the channel.” It’s how we consecrate the encounter—so that what bounces back at us has at least passed through an intention of faith.

We bless fields, homes, rosaries, fishing boats, backpacks on the first day of school. We ask priests to bless pets on St. Francis Day. Yet the objects through which most of our waking attention flows—phones, laptops, tablets, TVs—go unblessed, unguarded, spiritually unattended.

Why?

If our screens mediate our relationships, our work, our decisions, our imagination—then they are already part of our moral and spiritual life. Pretending otherwise doesn’t make them neutral; it just leaves them unclaimed.

So I’ve started doing something simple: I pray over my technology.
And yes—I’ve even trained my AI assistant to remind me to pray before I dive into a project. That tiny interruption has saved me from sliding into anxious productivity and helped me re-enter the work as an offering.

What Happens When We Pray Over Tech
Prayer doesn’t magic-proof a device. But it reorients the user.

When I pause and pray before opening a document, joining a video call, or asking AI to help me draft something delicate, several spiritual shifts happen:

Attention becomes offering. I’m not just zoning out; I’m showing up intentionally.
Guardrails rise. I remember that what I read, watch, and generate has consequences for souls—including mine.
Humility enters. I admit: “Lord, I need help to use this well. I am distractible. I am tempted.”
Discernment sharpens. I’m more likely to notice when a digital path is heading toward gossip, vanity, despair, or impurity—and to turn back.
Prayer doesn’t sanctify the code; it sanctifies the use.

When Screens Become a Household Liturgy
Imagine a parish challenge: one week where every family prays before powering up evening screens. Or a youth night where teens lay their phones on the altar rail and pray for wisdom in how they use them. Or a diocesan blessing of devices at the start of the school year.

This isn’t superstition. It’s stewardship.
St. Benedict taught us to pray and work. St. Escrivá urged us to sanctify ordinary tasks. In our generation, “ordinary” includes cloud storage and group chats. Let’s “baptize” them.

What Are We to Do?

I know there are dangers.
Misinformation. Deepfakes. Surveillance. Dehumanization.
These aren’t just sci-fi nightmares—they’re present threats, already eroding trust and truth.

We must talk about these things. But not from a place of panic.
The Church should be leading those conversations—not lagging behind, not just condemning what she doesn’t understand, but offering something richer: a vision of what it means to be human.

Society is going to change. That train has already left the station.
But what we can do is stand on the platform and start asking the deeper questions:

Where are we going?
What are we leaving behind?
And who do we become when we stop asking those questions?

As Catholics, we actually have the tools for this:
We believe in mystery.
We believe in incarnation.
We believe that matter—dust, bread, water, code—can be caught up into the life of grace.
We believe that evil can twist anything—but that God can bend anything back toward redemption.

Even AI.

But here’s something I need to say with equal conviction:
I do not think AI should be placed into the hands of the spiritually and morally unformed.

That may sound harsh. But it’s born of experience.

I have found AI fruitful because I’ve spent years in spiritual direction, therapy, confession, study, and prayer. I’ve cultivated self-awareness. I’ve trained myself to ask better questions. I don’t come to AI looking for identity. I come looking for insight.

But not everyone does.

If someone is unformed—if they lack discernment, self-possession, a conscience shaped by truth—then AI can become a seducer, a flatterer, a lie wrapped in helpful language.
It won’t lead them deeper. It will entrap them in an endless loop of affirmation and anxiety.

I worry especially about our children.
I do not think we should be integrating AI into early education.
Children need books, not bots.
They need silence, story, handwriting, and human conversation.
They need the texture of tradition before they touch the fluidity of digital intelligence.

You don’t give a child a scalpel before they know what a wound is.
You don’t give them fire until they’ve seen it both cook a meal and burn a house down.
We need to be just as cautious with AI.

Let the young be taught in traditional ways so they can one day approach technology with virtue, clarity, and wisdom.
Let formation precede innovation.

Because without moral and spiritual maturity, AI will not expand the soul—it will shrink it. Given the fact that social media apps these days are full of AI-generated videos, AI-native apps seem keen to cash in on the trend. The latest to jump on that bandwagon is Character.AI, which said on Monday that it is adding a social feed to its mobile apps that allow users to create AI characters and chat with them.

The social feed, which first came to the company’s web platform in June, lets users share images, videos, and their chatbots with other users. Users can also share snippets of their chats with characters, post AI-generated images based on their chats with a character, or even have their characters debate topics on a livestream.

The feed also lets you use the company’s generative video model, AvatarFX, to create video clips with text prompts and images, and share them on the feed.

“With our new Feed, the boundary between creator and consumer is disappearing. You can come to Feed for a lean-back experience and watch content from our amazing creators – but you can also take the story forward or create a new epic adventure,” said Karandeep Singh, Character.AI’s CEO, in a statement.

Character.AI isn’t the first company of its kind to dip its toes in the social media ocean: Video-generation app Pika in July launched an invite-only app that lets users create and post videos using AI tools. Legal AI startup Harvey hits $100 million in annual recurring revenue. Artificial intelligence startup Harvey on Monday announced it has reached $100 million in annual recurring revenue, or ARR, just three years after its launch. 

Harvey runs an AI-powered legal platform for lawyers at law firms and large corporations. Its technology can help with legal research, drafting and diligence projects, and the company is also building industry-specific use cases. 


Winston Weinberg, co-founder and CEO of Harvey, said the startup’s ARR milestone has largely been driven by usage. Harvey has surpassed 500 customers, including CNBC’s parent company, Comcast, and its weekly average users have quadrupled over the past year, the startup said. 

“Most of our accounts grow pretty massively,” Weinberg told CNBC. “You’ll sell to a Comcast or to a law firm, and they’ll buy a couple hundred seats, and then they expand that usage pretty quickly.” 

Weinberg is a former lawyer, and he co-founded Harvey with his friend and roommate Gabe Pereyra, a former research scientist at Google
 DeepMind and Meta
. The pair launched the company in 2022 after experimenting with OpenAI’s large language model GPT-3, which came out before its viral AI chatbot, ChatGPT.

Amazon stock sinks after earnings: Here are the key takeaways
The company’s name, Harvey, is partially inspired by one of the main characters in “Suits,” a legal drama TV series, Weinberg said.

Harvey has raised more than $800 million from investors, according to PitchBook, including Kleiner Perkins, Sequoia Capital and the OpenAI Startup Fund. The company also earned a spot on the 2025 CNBC Disruptor 50 list. 

“With gen AI, and how fast everything’s moving, you just have to learn how to scale really, really fast,” Weinberg said. “I’d say, like every six months I go through a new scaling experience.”

In the months ahead, Weinberg said Harvey is focused on its global expansion and continuing to build out its team. The startup recently hired Siva Gurumurthy, the former director of engineering at Twitter, as its chief technology officer, and John Haddock, who spent a decade at Stripe, as its chief business officer. 

Weinberg said he has learned to appreciate the value of a strong team, especially during periods of rapid growth. 

“We’re starting to get to the point where we have really good leadership in place,” Weinberg said. “That just changes your ability to scale to such a massive degree.” How businesses are adapting to the AI chatbots' takeover of search engines. Artificial intelligence chatbots are shaking up the way we use the internet, altering the search-for-clicks bargain that has shaped the landscape of the web for decades. Companies are scrambling to adjust. Perplexity is using stealth, undeclared crawlers to evade website no-crawl directives. A new federally funded national institute at Carnegie Mellon University will help mathematicians use artificial intelligence to make mathematical reasoning faster and more reliable in solving pressing challenges across science, security and the economy.

With an investment from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and additional support from the Simons Foundation, the Institute for Computer-Aided Reasoning in Mathematics (ICARM) — one of just six mathematics institutes across the U.S. to receive NSF support — will help researchers modernize mathematical reasoning to strengthen real-world problem solving in domains like cybersecurity, finance, space and health care.

The institute kicks off at a crucial moment as the mathematical community learns to incorporate new technology into its work.

“Emerging technologies based on formal methods, AI and machine learning are transforming the landscape of mathematical research,” said Theresa Mayer, vice president for research. “We are grateful to the National Science Foundation for its leadership in establishing ICARM and recognizing the importance of this moment. As host of the new institute, Carnegie Mellon is committed to supporting the mathematical sciences community through deep interdisciplinary collaboration and new frameworks for advancing fundamental discovery.”

Machine learning provides ways of detecting subtle mathematical patterns, which is helpful for everything from discovering drugs to predicting financial markets. Formal methods and automated reasoning are used to ensure that software systems perform correctly.

“The institute will focus on the mathematical components of these tasks and use the technologies to support mathematical reasoning and computation in all its applications,” said Jeremy Avigad, director of ICARM and professor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences and the Department of Philosophy at CMU. 

ICARM also will provide opportunities such as summer schools, workshops and a conference to explore the use of these technologies in mathematics. 

“While a focus of the institute will be on facilitating research in mathematical sciences, my hope is that the developed technologies will also play a crucial role in significantly improving the way mathematics can be taught in schools and colleges,” said Prasad Tetali, Alexander M. Knaster Professor and department head of Mathematical Sciences at Carnegie Mellon, who is part of the team that submitted the proposal to the NSF.
“Mathematical reasoning is foundational to many branches of science and engineering. When human insight and ingenuity are paired with machine-assisted formal reasoning, the scope of the outcome is limitless,” Tetali said. “The beauty of investment in foundational work is that the long-term impact is difficult to predict and often far more rewarding than originally targeted or imagined. I see great potential for breakthroughs in multiple mathematical research areas.”

The three-year pilot institute based at CMU will bring together researchers from the Mellon College of Science — including Irina Gheorghiciuc and Michael Young – with the School of Computer Science’s Marijn Heule and Sean Welleck, in collaboration with researchers at the University of South Carolina and Georgia Gwinnett College. 

In its announcement, the NSF said the institutes will continue to empower researchers to explore new areas of mathematics. The decision to launch this institute is a strong vote of confidence in its mission,” Avigad said.We are humbled by that trust, and we will do everything we can to make good on it.Trump administration reportedly has plan to send national guard to Louisiana - as it happened.
